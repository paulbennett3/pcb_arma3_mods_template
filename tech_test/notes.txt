# Requirements
- place a "respawn_west" marker near starting gate
- mark some object as "sgc_briefing" 
    - this has the mission generator "addAction"'d to it
    - also currently has loadouts "addAction"'d to it
- place initial gate, set to earth (or leave random)
 

# general
- if it is only run *once*, use execVM
- if it is used more than once, store as a function, then
    - if no sleep commands, "call" it
    - If it has sleep type commands, "spawn" it


# Function example
## in file "functions\fMyFunction.sqf";
params ["_myParam"];  // declare parameters
hint _myParam;        // do something 
_myParam;             // return a value

## compile it -- create a "preinit" function and define in cfgfunctions class of description.ext 
pcb_f_myfunction = (compilefinal preprocessfile "functions\fMyFunction.sqf");

## example usage
private _result = ["parameter"] call pcb_f_myfunction;
   OR
["parameter"] spawn pcb_f_myfunction;
