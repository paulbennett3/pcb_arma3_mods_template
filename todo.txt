- SCP base
- background stuff (patrols, buildings, things-of-interest) for missions
- "complications" for missions (Jaffa et al patrols, earthquakes, ...)
- SCP -- triangulate "source" based on N missions surrounding it
- scripted SGC base
- more than 1 action added to items (study, research, ...)
- underwater explore with MALP, diving gear
- Foe - "cultist", man in black
- add animations for search, study, ...
- hint in task for role(s) needed  "Explore P3X-432 -- study the Statue (scholar)"
- subtasks (find, study, multiple things to do, ...)
- limit area of operations to about 1.5k so stuff is more "dense"
- mission state / world state hashmaps as public variables
- setVariable on objects / vehicle (attach data structure / hashmap with whatever object data needed) - ala Matlab Handle graphics -- note -- objects are local to each client!
- SCP "campaign" -- start with little tech / resources, "earn" points (to buy? unlock?) better tech and support 
    - for example, completing missions (with no loss?), or doing "extra" things (exploring? clearing zombie hordes?)
- "realism" toggle -- on = delays for things, more actions, few if any "convenience" functions
- dynamic groups / scripted High Command (passing orders around, getting assigned control of units, ...)
- Inital start on destroyer (random location?), Heli-lift (with AI backup) and set up base
    - basic base
    - repair, refuel, re-arm depo (vehicles)
    - ???
    - add command(s):
         - deploy boats, move cargo to heli-pad, ...
- More "phasmaphobia" missions (ie, "boss" or "source" indicated by different spawns / phenomena)
- High Command addCommand - land, take off
- script / otherwise figure out getting AI to take more ammo
- food or other consumables?
- better weather randomization
   - vary fog base
   - have it change over the course of the mission (since sometimes we have 2+ hour missions ...)
- "self destruct" addCommand for vehicles so they can be destroyed without pissing off friendlies
- crew served weapons (in crate?)
- SCP operators as "independent", with ongoing west / east conflict?
- addAction to "strip" (leave uniform, vest, backpack?)
- allow for single player mode in the multiplayer missions (ie, taking control of AI units -- unit switch?)
- random selection of vehicles
    - cargo heli, possible a military heli
    - civ cars, possibly technicals
- effect to squelch / destroy electronics (lights, radios, gps, UAV, NVG, vehicles, ...)
- sling loadable shit
- "repellent" (smoke + "stay out of area" trigger for monsters)


Now
- delete HC heli transport
- fix assign of vehicle (both escort heli working?)
- bigger backpack in crate (use engineer unit backpack?)


Reminders
- run discord on other laptop
- use other laptop as server?
