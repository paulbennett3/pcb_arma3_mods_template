- SCP base
- SCP -- triangulate "source" based on N missions surrounding it
- scripted SGC base
- more than 1 action added to items (study, research, ...)
- underwater explore with MALP, diving gear
- Foe - "cultist", man in black
- add animations for search, study, ...
- hint in task for role(s) needed  "Explore P3X-432 -- study the Statue (scholar)"
- subtasks (find, study, multiple things to do, ...)
- mission state / world state hashmaps as public variables
- SCP "campaign" -- start with little tech / resources, "earn" points (to buy? unlock?) better tech and support 
    - for example, completing missions (with no loss?), or doing "extra" things (exploring? clearing zombie hordes?)
- "realism" toggle -- on = delays for things, more actions, few if any "convenience" functions
- dynamic groups / scripted High Command (passing orders around, getting assigned control of units, ...)
- Inital start on destroyer (random location?), Heli-lift (with AI backup) and set up base
    - basic base
    - repair, refuel, re-arm depo (vehicles)
    - ???
    - add command(s):
         - deploy boats, move cargo to heli-pad, ...
- More "phasmaphobia" missions (ie, "boss" or "source" indicated by different spawns / phenomena)
- script / otherwise figure out getting AI to take more ammo
- crew served weapons (in crate?)
- SCP operators as "independent", with ongoing west / east conflict?
- effect to squelch / destroy electronics (lights, radios, gps, UAV, NVG, vehicles, ...)
- sling loadable shit
- "repellent" (smoke + "stay out of area" trigger for monsters)
- more "spawn in military bases" (in addition to crates).  Also, more random chance, and extend to
    entire ellipse again (ie, balance out elipse density with p(spawn))
- background: Jet or Heli (or barrage) on some position (fairly brief, but exciting!)
- set move speed for patrols?  Might have to change how these are spawned.  Maybe "getWaypoint" on group 
    after BIS_fnc_patrol (or whatever) -- would have to iterate through waypoint indices ...
- test if claymores auto-trigger on enemy
- work on parachute stuff -- para-insertion (NPCs, loads, etc)
     - start in heli, load from its cargo, drop (NPC in charge of heli, not assigned to player so
       the only option is "out").  Over a military base? Hot zone?  Where to put respawn point?
- fix current animal "follow". Doesn't seem to work ?!?
- add more variety of animal spawn -- "packs", wandering, ...
- Put all type strings in one file, filter by add on (steal code from Drongo)
- Threat detector -- tie to Zombies?
- Build my own "AI" for units (steal ideas from Drongo)
- "Short" missions (ie, one action then done) - para-insert, blow something up / investigate / et al, then exfil
- Firing range missions (spawn targets at random distances)
- Tower defense mission (start in one of the cool bases, spawn in ammo, support troops, goal is to hold
        for N amount of time versus randomly spawned zombies and anomalies ...)
